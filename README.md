# Be_Live

Be_Live is a community-maintained calendar for virtual events that one can attend from home. It was created by @m-gizzi and @abarrdev days after our state initiated a stay-at-home order due to the COVID-19 outbreak.


## Current Features

* user can view, add, and edit events
* user can filter by specific attributes (such as whether or not the event is ongoing or private)
* user can search for event(s) dynamically (matches to query update upon keystroke)
